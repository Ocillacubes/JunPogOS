# JunPogOS
Finally getting around to loonixing again.

# What is this
This is meant to give the user a functioning Artix GNU/Linux system that I would enjoy using, as well as be comfortable for others to use.

# Options
I plan to have a couple of options during the installation process - mainly being whether or not you need wifi/linux-firmware, whether or not you want the full tint2 *experience* or just a normal bar, if you wish to encrypt your drives, and whether or not you need some larger programs such as gimp/kdenlive.

# What is included
As of right now the list of software I'm looking at includes the following:

## Base utilities
* The Artix base system with openrc
* Git
* crytpsetup/lvm2
* ffmpeg
* dhcpcd/network manager

## "Desktop Enviornment"
* Window Manager: herbstluftwm
* Panel: Tint2
* Login Manager: either tty or lightdm, not sure yet

## Browsers

## Text Editors
* Neovim
* Leafpad
